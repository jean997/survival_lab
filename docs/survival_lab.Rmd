# Packages We Will Use

- `survival`: Does most of the heavy lifting

- `survminer`: Contains `ggsurvfit` which makes nice plots. 

- `dplyr`: Data management

- `ggplot2`: Other plotting options

```{r, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(survival)
library(survminer)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

---
# Example Data

- We will use the `lung` data which is built into the `survival` package. 

- Data on 228 patients with advanced lung cancer. 
  - `status`: censoring status, 1 = censored, 2 = died
  - `time`: time baseline to censoring or death in days 
  - `age` (years), `sex` (1 = male, 2 = female)
  - `ph.ecog`: 4 level ECOG performance score, 0 = best, 3 = worst (bedbound)
  - `ph.karno`: Karnofsky performance rated by physician, 0 to 100, 0 worst, 100 best 
  - `pat.karno`: Karnofsky performance as rated by the patient
  - `meal.cal`: Calories consumed in meals
  - `wt.loss`: Pounds lost in last six months
  
---
# Example Data  
```{r}
head(lung)
lung %>% group_by(status) %>%
    summarize(n = n(), mean = mean(time), median = median(time), 
              q1 = quantile(time, 0.25), q3 = quantile(time, 0.75))
```

- Average follow-up time is longer in patients who were censored than patients who died. 
  - This is expected, and will essentially always be true in time-to-event data.

# Kaplan-Meier Curves

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[R Code]
```{r bplot, fig.show='hide', fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=10}
fit1 <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data=lung)
# Basic Plot
plot(fit1, mark.time=TRUE)
```

```{r pplot, fig.show='hide', fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=10}
# Pretty Plot
ggsurvplot(fit1, 
           risk.table = TRUE, 
           ggtheme = theme_bw(base_size = 16), 
           legend = "none")
```

- `Surv` creates a survival object from a vector of censoring times and a vector of event types. 
  + Default is right censoring, but options for left, interval, and a few others are available.
  
- `survfit` in this usage estimates the Kaplan-Meier estimate.

# KM Curves by Strata


```{r kmsex, fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=12}
fit2 <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data=lung)
names(fit2$strata) <- c("Male", "Female")
ggsurvplot(fit2, 
           risk.table = TRUE, 
           conf.int = TRUE,
           ggtheme = theme_bw(base_size = 16), 
           legend = "right", tables.height = 0.3)
```


---
# Median Survival

- Median survival is the time $t^*$ at which $S(t^*) = 0.5$
- The `survfit` object will print the median by default, get other quantiles with `quantile`.

```{r}
fit1
quantile(fit1, probs = c(0.1, 0.25)) %>% data.frame()
```

- The naive approach gives the wrong answer
```{r}
filter(lung, status == 2) %>% with(., median(time)) # Don't do this
```

---
# Median Survival

```{r kmsex2, fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=12, echo=FALSE}
fit2 <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data=lung)
names(fit2$strata) <- c("Male", "Female")
ggsurvplot(fit2, 
           risk.table = TRUE, 
           conf.int = TRUE,
           surv.median.line = "hv",
           ggtheme = theme_bw(base_size = 25), 
           legend = "right", 
           tables.height = 0.3)
```

- Median survival is 156 days longer in females than in males. 
  
---
# Testing for Differences

- The `survdiff` function will compute a non-parametric test for a difference in survival curves. 
- By default, it computes the log-rank test. The null hypothesis tested is that the survival curves are the same in both (or all) groups.
  + p-value is probably the only interesting part of the output. 
  + Usually, we will end up fitting a parametric model to compare groups so that we can account for other variables.
```{r}
survdiff(Surv(time, status) ~ ph.ecog, data = lung)
```


---
# Fitting a Cox Model

- The `coxph` function will fit a Cox proportional hazards regression model. 

```{r}
coxfit1 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + age +  ph.karno, data = lung)
summary(coxfit1)
```

- We estimate that the hazard in females is 0.61 times the hazard in males, adjusting for sex, ECOG score, and Karnofsky score (95% CI: 0.44-0.85). 

---
# Estimating Survival Curves

- Displaying survival curves estimated from the fitted model can help with interpretation. 

- We need to choose some covariate values for our curves. 
  - The median age in the data is 63. 
  - The 75th percentile of Karnofsky score is 90 (relatively healthy patients).
  - The 25th percentile of Karnofsky score 70 (less healthy patients).
  
- We will plot survival curves for male and female patients of median age with Karnofsky scores of 90 and 70 (so four curves).

# Checking Proportional Hazards

- There are two methods (that I know of) for assessing proportion hazards. 

- For a binary or categorical variable, we can create a complimentary log-log plot of the Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. 
  + Lines should be parallel if hazards are proportional.
  + Use the `fun = "cloglog"` option in `ggsurvplot`
  
- `coxph.zph` will conduct a formal test for proportionality. 
  + It will also create a diagnostic plot estimating a time-varying coefficient for each variable. 
  + This can help us diagnose problems.

# Accounting for Non-Proportional Hazards

Three strategies for accommodating non-proportional hazards within Cox regression:

1. Convert a time-fixed covariate into one or more time-varying covariates. 

2. Stratify the model on a discrete covariate. 

3. Artificially truncate time after a certain point.

I will talk about 1 and 2. 

---
# Stratified Cox Regression

- In a stratified Cox regression, we let subgroups of the data have different baseline hazards. 

- Suppose $V$ is a categorical variable with $K$ levels. We want to fit the model

$$\lambda(t; X, V, \beta) = \lambda_{0, V}(t)exp(X^\top \beta)$$
- We will estimate $K$ different (non-parametric) baseline hazard functions. 

---
# Stratified Cox Regression 

- Our problematic covariate is Karnofsky score which has 6 levels. 
  + Stratification is more commonly used for categorical variables like sex or diagnosis but we will go ahead with this example. 
```{r}
table(lung$ph.karno)
```

- To stratify on a covariate we wrap it in `strat()` inside the formula. 

```{r}
coxfit2 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + age + 
                   + strata(ph.karno), data = lung)
summary(coxfit2)$coefficients
summary(coxfit1)$coefficients
```



- Coefficient estimates for age and sex are very similar, we have lost a small amount of precision. 

- We can't easily make inference about the association between survival and Karnofsky score. 

- But we can still plot estimated survival curves.

# Time-Varying Covariates


- The plot produced by `cox.zph` is showing us that we might be better off with a time-varying *coefficient* for Karnofsky score. 
$$\lambda(t; X, \beta) = \lambda_0(t) \exp(\beta(t)X)$$
- We can't fit this model directly in the Cox regression framework, but we can achieve an equivalent model by creating one or more time-varying *covariates* based on $X$. 

$$\lambda(t; \tilde{X}, \theta) = \lambda_0(t) \exp(\theta^\top\tilde{X}(t))$$

---
# Time-Varying Covariates

- Suppose we want a coefficient that is piece-wise constant with a single knot at time $T$:

$$\beta(t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 I(t > T)\\\
\beta(t)x = \beta_0 x + \beta_1 I(t > T) x$$

- So we could define a new covariate $\tilde{X}(t) = I(t > T)X$ and then fit our model adjusting for both $X$ and $\tilde{X}(t)$


- <a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/vignettes/timedep.pdf">This is a great resource by Terry Therneau, Cynthia Cowson, and Elizabeth Atkinson.</a>
---
# Time-Varying Covariates

- We could try to fit $\beta(t)$ as a step function

- Or we could try to find a continuous transformation of time under which the $\beta(t)$ is about linear. 


- To help us, the `cox.zph` function has an argument `transform`. 

  + `transform` lets us specify a transformation of the x-axis. 
  + We can look for a transformation that gives a more linear looking estimate of $\beta(t)$
  

```{r zplot2, fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=10}
zplog <- cox.zph(coxfit1, transform = function(time) log(time + 20))
plot(zplog[3], xlab = "time, scaled as log(time + 20)")
abline(h = coxfit1$coefficients[3], col="red", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
```

+ This transformation doesn't really look like it gives us a linear hazard over time. 
  + If it did, we could need to create a time varying covariate $\tilde{X}(t) = X log(t + 20)$ and add it to the regression.

+ For our example, we will use the step-function approach and fit a piecewise constant function with knots at 200 and 450 days.

# Time-Varying Covariates

- We can't just put time into the formula in the Cox regression. We will get a warning and the wrong answer.

```{r}
coxfit3 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + age +  
                   ph.karno + I(ph.karno*time), data = lung)
```

- The problem is that `time` is doing double duty in this expression. 

- R reads this as an interaction between Karnofsky score and censoring time which isn't what we want. 


---
# Time-Varying Covariates

- Fortunately the `coxph` function has a built in syntax for this: `tt()`.

- Any covariates that we want to make time-varying, we wrap in `tt()`. 

- We then have to specify what `tt` does as an argument to `coxph`. 

- Below we fit a linear term for time 
```{r}
coxfit3 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + age +  ph.karno + tt(ph.karno),
                 tt = function(x, t,...) x*t, data = lung)
```

- Under the hood, R is creating an expanded data set with one row for each person at each time that anyone in the data was either censored or died. 
---
# Time-Varying Covariates

- To fit a piece-wise model with two breaks, we need to add two time-varying covariates:
  + $X I(t > 200)$ and $X I(t > 450)$

- To do this, we let the the function given to `tt` return multiple columns. 

```{r}
coxfit4 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + age +  ph.karno + tt(ph.karno),
                 tt = function(x, t,...){
                   cbind(karno1 = x*(t > 200), karno2 = x*(t > 450))
                 } , data = lung)
summary(coxfit4)$coefficients
```

---
# Time-Varying Covariates

- We can try plotting our time-varying estimates on top of the plot from `cox.zph` to see if we are doing better. 

- By defualt, `cox.zph` transforms time using the "km" transformation, so we need to 
put our fitted values on this scale. 
  + Or refit using the "identity" transform.

```{r zplot3, fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=10}
plot(zp[3])
t1 <- zp$x[zp$time == 199]
t2 <- zp$x[zp$time ==450]
b <- function(t){coxfit4$coefficients[3] + 
                 coxfit4$coefficients[4]*(t > t1) + 
                 coxfit4$coefficients[5]*(t > t2)}
curve(b(x), add = TRUE, col = "blue", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
```

---
# Time-Varying Covariates

- Since Karnofsky score is now represented by three covariates, in order to test the significance we need to test that all three coefficients are equal to zero. 

- One way to do this is to use a likelihood ratio test to compare nested models.

- `anova` will not work the model with `tt()` covariates is using the expanded long format data. 

- We have to compute the LR test statistic by hand. 
  + Be careful that your models are really nested!

```{r}
coxfit0 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + age, 
                 data = lung, subset = which(!is.na(lung$ph.karno)))
lr0 <- 2*(coxfit4$loglik - coxfit0$loglik)[2]
c(lr0, pchisq(lr0, df = 3, lower.tail = FALSE))
```

- This test statistic should have $\chi^2_{3}$ distribution under the null. The 3 came from the number of parameters we put in for Karnofsky score. 

---
# Time-Varying Covariates

- We could also test how much better the model with the time dependent covariates is than the model without. 

```{r}
lr1 <- 2*(coxfit4$loglik - coxfit1$loglik)[2]
c(lr1, pchisq(lr1, df = 2, lower.tail = FALSE))
```

- Seems like the time-varying model is fitting better.


---
# Time-Varying Covariates


- Retrieving fitted survival curves is a little trickier. 

- `survfit` won't work on fits that include `tt()` terms. 

- Instead, we have to refit the model creating the expanded data set ourselves and then 
estimate the survival curves. 

  + The linked time-dependent pdf and the <a hreft="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/vignettes/survival.pdf">survival package documentation</a> both show how to do this.
